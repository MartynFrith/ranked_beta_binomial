Ranked Beta Binomial (RBB)

Reference-based deconvolution of cell type composition from cfDNA samples using methylation sequencing data. This software utilises a Baysesian approach to account for the missingness of sequencing data used for the construction of cell type deconvolution reference atlases. Detection of cell type(s) of interest is optimised by calculating relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the target cell type and all other cell types at each CpG site in the genome, and then constructing the reference atlas using the n sites with the highest relative entropy.
